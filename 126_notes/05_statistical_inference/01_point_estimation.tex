\section{Point Estimation}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Probability vs Statistics}: There exists two perspectives
	      that surround the field of statistical inference,
	      Bayesian vs Frequentist.
	      \begin{enumerate}
		      \item From the Bayesian perspective, unknown quantities
		            are treated as RVs with known or assumed distributions and priors.
		      \item While under the Frequentist's point of view, unknowns
		            are deterministic parameters that need to be estimated.
	      \end{enumerate}
	      In essence, a person following the Bayesian perspective starts
	      with a probabilistic model and assumes its distribution and shows
	      through rigorous probabilistic analysis that measurements get
	      smaller.

	      On the other hand, a Frequentist would make hidden assumptions about
	      parameters present in the model for which we know knowing about.
	\item \textbf{Bayesian Inference:}
